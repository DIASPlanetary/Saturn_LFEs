## Requirements
We recommend creating a new environment with Python 3.13.1+ and Jupyter Server installed. Simply install the required packages by running this command in your newly created environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next you can change the filepaths in the config.ini file or use the default config.
